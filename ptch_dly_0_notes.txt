This series explores the relationship between grain pitch and feedback delay in granular FM feedback.
Modulation index is kept at 1, and grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
Grain duration is kapt at 1.5 for all examples.
Grain pitch varies from 200 to 800 in all examples, while the feedbacl delay setting varies between each example.

The feedback delay strongly influence which sideband patterns we get. 
So far we have not observed a pattern. 
In certain parameter ranges, minor changes may have dramatic effect, while in other ranges it is a less significant change.
