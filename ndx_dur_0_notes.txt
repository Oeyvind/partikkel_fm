This series explores the relationship between fm index and grain duration.
Mod index is automated from 0.5 to 1.2 in all examples. There is a separate example for each grain duration setting, kept constant through each example.
The evolution is generally that longer grain rates give more modulation. 
BUT, the trajectory of when sidebands appear is different. Note for example how the first subharmonic sidebands appear:
- gr.dur=0.6 : subharmonics appear at 2.3 seconds
- gr.dur=0.7 : subharmonics appear at 1.5 seconds
- gr.dur=0.8 : subharmonics appear at 1.0 seconds
- gr.dur=0.9 : subharmonics appear at 0.9 seconds
- gr.dur=1.0 : subharmonics appear at 0.6 seconds
- gr.dur=1.1 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.2 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.25 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.3 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.35 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.4 : subharmonics appear at 0.5 seconds
- gr.dur=1.5 : subharmonics appear at 0.7 seconds
- gr.dur=1.6 : subharmonics appear at 0.9 seconds
- gr.dur=1.7 : subharmonics appear at 0.9 seconds
- gr.dur=1.8 : subharmonics appear at 0.8 seconds
- gr.dur=1.9 : subharmonics appear at 0.6 seconds
- gr.dur=1.0 : subharmonics appear at 0.6 seconds
- gr.dur=1.1 : subharmonics appear at 0.55 seconds
The second subharmonic sidebands shows a similar nonlinear evolution (with respect to increasing graindur).

Note also the nonlinear evolution of sidebands (with respect to increasing graindur) from gr.dur=1.2 to 1.4.
Two extra examples are inserted to show more details. A graindur of 1.3 give less dense sidebands than 1.25 and 1.35.
