* notes for hig mod index, and focusing mainly on the granular model
* relationship between cps and phase delay
- seems like the magic phase spot changes with pitch, but not in linear proportions
- there is a sweep spot for frequency/phase delay combinations, and it might be repeating in integer multiples of the cps
* test more specifically to find where the sweet spots repeat (when we have harmonic splitting of sidebands rather than just going straight to chaos)

* hipass cleans up much with the granular model
* lowpass can also disturb where otherwise we might have order/harmonic sidebands. But can also rein in a slightly chaotic situation.
* am stabilizes, but only until it doesn't

* grain dur: lower grain dur stabilizes, but also creates upper sidebands from the start
- it might stabilize to the point where the result is "just granular"
* TRY: higher grain pitch with shorter grain duration, so that we manage to get at least a whole cycle of the waveform in each grain
- beware of phase delay values that might put the modulation exactly between grains (effectively no modulation)

* grain pitch: interesting variations, sometimes possible to get cleaner sidebands. Grain pitch does not neccessarily have to be integer transposition of grain rate
- check theory from Springer Csound book, when grain pitch is not integer og grain rate (extra sidebands?)
