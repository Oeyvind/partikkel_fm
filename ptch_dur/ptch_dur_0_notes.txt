This series explores the relationship between grain pitch and grain duration in granular FM feedback.
Modulation index is kept at 0.9, and grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
Grain pitch varies from 200 to 800 in all examples, while the grain dur setting varies between each example.

We note that we can recognize some of the sideband patterns are recognizable from the ndx_ptch examples, 
where regions of grain pitch corresponds in complexity. This comment assuming the same grain dur (1.3 in the ndx_ptch examples) and mod index (varying in those same examples)

We also note that shorter grain duration generally gives lower complexity of sidebands (e.g. for duration below 1.0)
The complexity increase is somewhat linearly related to grain duration.

For grain durations 1.7 and above, we start to see sidebands "stepping motion" corresponding to grain pitch changes (se ptch_dur_10 with gr.dur=1.7)
The sidebands move from one integer division to another. Interesting that the sidebands do not "sweep" but step.
It seems the sidebands can only appear at integer subdivisions of the fundamental (?)(!!)

Particularly interesting duration values: 1.1 to 1.7 (extending lower and higher depending on mod index)
