This series explores the relationship between fm index and feedback delay (in fractions of a waveform cycle). Grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
The modulation index varies from 0 to 2 (a little bit higher than in other series of experiments), as some delay settings will require higher modulation indices for sidebands to occur.

We note that timbre complexity (number of sidebands) oscillates with varying delay time. There are some regions of delay times that appear more stable (less complex timbre).

We see no new sidebands at delay values 0, 0.18, 0.48.
Low complexity at delay values 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.47, 0.49.
The low end (below delay = 0.5) seems to show generally lower complexity, but with have regions of higher complexity at 0.13, 0.17, 0.21-0.45.

Transition from simple to complex: It might be interesting to find parameter values where we have a longer transition from first sidebands to more complex timbres.
Delay values with short transition time (nothing much happening before it sudddenly is complex): 
0.17, 0.2-0.4, 0.49-0.57, 1.0-1.1, 1.45-1.6, 1.85-2.0, 2.4-2.6, 2.8-3.1, ... a bit more unclear above these values (retains some order within the complexity).
a preliminary observation might lead us to think that values around half and whole duty cycles give more abrupt transitions into complexity.

Examples with longer transitions, where different sideband configurations can be more clearly discerned:
0.15, 0.4-0.48, 0.58-0.64 and more clearly 0.66-0.68, 0.7-0.9, 1.2-1.4, 1.7-1.75, 2.2-2.3, 2.7-2.8 (dense sidebands but somewhat orderly), 3.2-3.3 (similar)

In some regions (of delay time values), the behaviour changes significantly with small adjustments. In other regions the behaviour stays similar over a reange of values.
Regions of interest (more nuances with small adjustments): 0.1-0.18, 0.45-0.48, 0.58-0.9, 1.65-1.75, 2.2-2.3, 2.7, 3.2-3.3.


TODO: 
  - look through the examples/png and note delay time regions that give higher or lower complexity
  - also look for regions of delay time that provide more variations in complexity with very small adjustments to the delay time
  - the examples have been prepared with this in mind, making larger increments of delay time where less prominent variation can be observed
  - also note delay values that makes the sidebands split in 3 equal spacings rather than 2 (ndx_dly_57 is one such)
    - 77 and 78 split in 5 equal sidebands
  - and note delay times that provide timbral evolution, rather than abrupt transition from simple to chaos. 
    - there are significant differences, 
      - for example some settings that let the first sidebands appear but nothing else
      - some values have almost no transition
      - other values keep the sonic nuances of several sidebands rather long into the chaotic region (looks like dense/chaotic in the spectrogram)
        - for example ndx_dly_64
