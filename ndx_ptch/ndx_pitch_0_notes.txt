This series explores the relationship between fm index and grain pitch. Grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
Apparently is the relationship between grain rate and grain pitch that makes a difference for the evolution of sidebands with linearly increasing modulation index.
Mod index is automated from 0.5 to 1.2 in all examples. There is a separate example for each grain pitch setting, kept constant through each example.
One can note that changing the grain pitch makes for a diffferent evolution of sidebands with increasing modulation index. The pattern is not yet clear, but it seems to oscillate back and forth in complexity with linearly increasing grain pitch.

Note also that new sidebands generally occur halfway between excisting sidebands (octaviation). 
A notable exception is for grain pitch 545Hz (and upwards until 580Hz) (example 22-25), where we see another distance between sidebands. 
Here it seems the excisting sidebands are split in three equal distances (5ths as opposed to octaves). 
We observe (sometimes easier to hear than see) also in example 40-49, where the grain pitch varies from 670 to 740.
The ranges are approximate as also neighbouring ranges show some of the 5th's sidebands.
Interesting observation: the splitting into 5ths (3 equal sidebands) does not occur at grain pitches corresonding to a 3-divided ratio (like 1.5, giving a grain pitch of 600, where we might expect this to happen intuitively).
Still, if we broadly define a region where this phenomenon occurs we see it happening between 540 and 750 Hz, which lies "somewhere around 600Hz".
Additionally, we can see traces of this 3-division at the end of example 88-90 (grain rate 1380-1400Hz)
Moreover, we can se sidbands splitting into 5 equal spaced sidebands at gr.pitch=1220 (3.3 seconds into the file ndx_ptch_75), and more clearly at gr.pitch 1230. 
We also see this intermittently with gr.pitch=1320 to 1340. At gr.pitch=1400 we see an intermittent split into 7 equal spaced sidebands (2.7 second into the file ndx_ptch_90).

We observe a lack of extra sidebands at several grain pitch ranges. These are (220-330, 465-540, 800-830, 845-940), similarly also very late sidebands at 1100-1190).
The example files for this are: 2-4, 21-22, 56-57,59-60, 68-71
Noteworthy are the in the middle of a range with no extra sidebands (broadly speaking 800-940Hz), we observe some complexity happening at 835-840 Hz. 
As if the waveforms that should "line up", misses by a small fraction, and then is brought back in line at the slightly higher grain pitch (845Hz).

The evolution of sidebands with increason modulation index will sometimes pass through more complex regions and then reside again. This happens for example with grain pitch = 730 Hz (example 48).
This indicates that there is some stabilizing force, pulling the sideband complexity back even when modulation index increases.
