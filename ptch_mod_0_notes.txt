This series explores the relationship between grain pitch and modulation index in granular FM feedback.
Grain duration is kept at 1.5, and grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
Feedback delay is kept at 0.77 for all examples.
Mod index varies between each example.

Mod index has a more or less linear effect on timbre complexity as expected. 
The time at which sidebands occur (corresponding to grain pitch) is noteworthy:
  - For several mod index values, the area of higher complexity might stay in the same place, then with the next mod index increment,
  we might get a "hole" (less complex timbre) in that same position
