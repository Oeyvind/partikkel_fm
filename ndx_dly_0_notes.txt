This series explores the relationship between fm index and feedback delay (in fractions of a waveform cycle). Grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
The modulation index varies from 0 to 2 (a little bit higher than in other series of experiments), as some delay settings will require higher modulation indices for sidebands to occur.

We note that timbre complexity (number of sidebands) oscillates with varying delay time. There are some regions of delay times that appear more stable (less complex timbre).

TODO: 
  - look through the examples/png and note delay time regions that give higher or lower complexity
  - also look for regions of delay time that provide more variations in complexity with very small adjustments to the delay time
  - the examples have been prepared with this in mind, making larger increments of delay time where less prominent variation can be observed
