This series explores the relationship between fm index and feedback delay (in fractions of a waveform cycle). Grain rate (fundamental frequency) is kept at 400 Hz in all examples.
The modulation index varies from 0 to 2 (a little bit higher than in other series of experiments), as some delay settings will require higher modulation indices for sidebands to occur.

We note that timbre complexity (number of sidebands) oscillates with varying delay time. There are some regions of delay times that appear more stable (less complex timbre).

TODO: 
  - look through the examples/png and note delay time regions that give higher or lower complexity
  - also look for regions of delay time that provide more variations in complexity with very small adjustments to the delay time
  - the examples have been prepared with this in mind, making larger increments of delay time where less prominent variation can be observed
  - also note delay values that makes the sidebands split in 3 equal spacings rather than 2 (ndx_dly_57 is one such)
    - 77 and 78 split in 5 equal sidebands
  - and note delay times that provide timbral evolution, rather than abrupt transition from simple to chaos. 
    - there are significant differences, 
      - for example some settings that let the first sidebands appear but nothing else
      - some values have almost no transition
      - other values keep the sonic nuances of several sidebands rather long into the chaotic region (looks like dense/chaotic in the spectrogram)
        - for example ndx_dly_64
